# Quadratic Equation Solver
## Description
This program is used to solve quadratic equation. It either takes filepath with coefficients from command line, or takes them from user.
Coefficients are real numbers, and the first coefficient (a) is non-zero.

## Installation and usage
This project is created using C++ language. All you need to do in order to launch project is to compile solve.cpp file.
Program can be either executed without any command line arguments, in which case it reads from user input, or take a filename and read coefficients from it.

File format for reading coefficients is specific - it is three numbers separated by space ('\s'). After third number always should be line ending ('\n').

Example: 3 2 1\n
